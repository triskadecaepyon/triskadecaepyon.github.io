__Presentations and Workshops__:

- EuroPython 2017 (Rimini, Italy)
  - [A Hands-on approach to tuning Python applications for performance](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/a-hands-on-approach-to-tuning-python-applications-for-performance), presented at EuroPython 2017 in Rimini, Italy to over 70 attendees. Created all of the 3-hour content and curriculum, and delivered in collaboration with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, covering advanced Python vectorization techniques and code profiling.
  - [Infrastructure design patterns with Python, Buildbot, and Linux Containers](https://ep2017.europython.eu/conference/talks/infrastructure-design-patterns-with-python-buildbot-and-linux-containers), presented at EuroPython 2017 in Rimini, Italy to over 100 attendees. Created and authored all content and methods displayed in presentation.
