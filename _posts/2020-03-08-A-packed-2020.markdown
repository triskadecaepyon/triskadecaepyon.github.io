My last year has been action packed, with a Keynote at EuroSciPy and my first trip to the SuperComputing Conference.  For this 2020 year, my focus has shifted from the being the main "Python guy" at Intel to working on Machine Learning Solutions for customers and helping shape the strategy of how ML is dealt with in our customer installations.  A significant amount of my travel this year will be focused on Universities, introducing students to the appropriate methods of doing Data Science work in their every day research or work.
  I'll be basing much of my work on the work I did as a data science during my consulting phase of my career.

  As for conferences, I'll have to see how the year pans out.  With the travel restrictions happening at many of the large public events, I'm not sure how much I'll see at the beginning of the year.
