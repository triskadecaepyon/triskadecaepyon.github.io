<p>The conference season has started, and with PyCon 2017 done, I now look forward to the EuroPython 2017 event.  The most unfortunate part of this year’s conference season is that a large amount of scheduling conflicts exist–with PyData Seattle, SciPy, and EuroPython all landing within similar days, I had to make a decision early on to choose one of the three to go to.  Now that my abstracts have been accepted, I’ll have to iron out the logistics of a trip to Rimini and get all my workshop materials in line.</p>

<p>There will be a few other notable conferences that will be hard to achieve this year, but such is the nature of the conference season.</p>
