<p>The 2018 Conference Season is imminent, and in classic style I have packed it full with SciPy and EuroPython on the horizon.  Throughout the last year I’ve seen the needs of the Python community change, and as such I have had to create all new material to cater to the changing landscape of High Performance Computing and Machine Learning. Last year’s material is ironically already getting dated-that’s how fast the landscape changes in the Python world.</p>

<p>This year also marks the first time I’ll be expected to show up at a few conferences, so balancing the presentation work while simultaneously keeping up my software development work will be an interesting challenge.  I have a few ideas for projects in the space, but of course finding extra cycles in the middle of a busy year always proves to be interesting.</p>

<p>From now until late August will be the crux of the conference season, so stay tuned for all the updates coming to my works/presentation page!</p>
