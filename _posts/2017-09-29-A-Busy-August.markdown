With September nearly done, it's worth looking back and seeing how busy my August was.  Less than 2 weeks after landing back from EuroPython, it was off to teach the Stanford ME344 class on advanced computing tools.  The topic of course was Python, but in this case I created all new material to try to address what would be the crux of most of the engineers in the room.  What hasn't been talked about often is when to stay in the Python layer and when to exit it; in some cases it will end up being the irreducible bottleneck if one's code remains in pure Python.  Explaining the different ways in which to determine when to migrate one's code to C has been a point of contention, but at some point one must make the move if the computation needs advanced parallelism.

Next, my August webinar was received well, with lots of great questions about the advanced performance libraries and some of the modified material from the previous Stanford class.  The nature of Python usage is evolving, as well as the types of users it envelops in industry.  As such, the constant evolution of presented material is necessary to provide the best knowledge sharing possible--with more and more users picking up Python, we'll have to start addressing even more use cases and domains.
