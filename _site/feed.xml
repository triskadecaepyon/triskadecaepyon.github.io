Throughout the last year I’ve seen the needs of the Python community change, and as such I have had to create all new material to cater to the changing landscape of High Performance Computing and Machine Learning. Last year’s material is ironically already getting dated-that’s how fast the landscape changes in the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year also marks the first time I’ll be expected to show up at a few conferences, so balancing the presentation work while simultaneously keeping up my software development work will be an interesting challenge.  I have a few ideas for projects in the space, but of course finding extra cycles in the middle of a busy year always proves to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now until late August will be the crux of the conference season, so stay tuned for all the updates coming to my works/presentation page!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">The 2018 Conference Season is imminent, and in classic style I have packed it full with SciPy and EuroPython on the horizon.

Most of my conferences have stemmed around general Python or Machine Learning, but none that covered High Performance Computing (HPC).  The venue was one of the world’s leading simulation facilities, the Commissariat à l’énergie atomique or &lt;strong&gt;CEA&lt;/strong&gt;.  As Data science starts to converge towards HPC-style problems, managing one’s environments and workflows becomes paramount with the amount of mixed Python and C code that has started to occur in compute centers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attendees were shown a significant amount of new material from other visiting HPC Universities and organizations, but the newest material would be the information I was to showcase-achieving High Performance Python in Modern HPC workflows.  With the amount of recent graduates fluent in Python, to the modern frameworks that allow for easier problem setup, Python has become integral into HPC’s future.  I’ve had the chance to work with many advanced Python workflows in HPC through relationships with compute centers and former consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the reaction from the attendees was promising.  With some people at an advanced level (and the rest of them new to Python but fluent at C), much of the advice and guidance hit the mark.  As new challenges arrive for those working with legacy C codebases, the integration of Python and C applications in the compute center are become the next big challenge in HPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slide deck and material is available on my Works/Publications page.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">The Virtual Institute - High Productivity Supercomputing (VI-HPS) conference in Paris, France was a unique opportunity for me earlier this year.

Less than 2 weeks after landing back from EuroPython, it was off to teach the Stanford ME344 class on advanced computing tools.  The topic of course was Python, but in this case I created all new material to try to address what would be the crux of most of the engineers in the room.  What hasn’t been talked about often is when to stay in the Python layer and when to exit it; in some cases it will end up being the irreducible bottleneck if one’s code remains in pure Python.  Explaining the different ways in which to determine when to migrate one’s code to C has been a point of contention, but at some point one must make the move if the computation needs advanced parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, my August webinar was received well, with lots of great questions about the advanced performance libraries and some of the modified material from the previous Stanford class.  The nature of Python usage is evolving, as well as the types of users it envelops in industry.  As such, the constant evolution of presented material is necessary to provide the best knowledge sharing possible–with more and more users picking up Python, we’ll have to start addressing even more use cases and domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">With September nearly done, it’s worth looking back and seeing how busy my August was.

The types of problems dealt with and the focus in Python is quite different from the US, and catering to the common issues seen in the workloads was a great learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the chance to explore both Munich, Germany and Rimini, Italy was the opportunity of a lifetime, and the path there wasn’t easy.  Logistic difficulties nearly the entire trip, yet the beauty of the cities and the people helped to balance the difficulties out.  One of the coolest things to see was the proximity of national science and physics labs in the EU–because of how close all the countries are (in comparison to the sprawl of the US), more lab-to-lab collaborations are present than in the US.  This in turn accelerates the type of work being done in the region, and shifts focus to some of the harder problems in the scientific world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, another fun aspect was exploring the cities and countries of the EU.  As my second trip the EU, I got to see how different they were to both the US and other countries I’ve traveled to.  Deep roots in tradition and culture, they help put into perspective some of the traditions I see in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the next journey, wherever the next conference takes me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">EuroPython 2017 was quite an adventure, and it was an honor to present my two talks (one talk and one 3 hour tutorial) to the EU Python community.
